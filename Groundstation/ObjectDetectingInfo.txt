The uploaded code can be used both on Windows and Linux, as long as OpenCV 2.4.10
or later is installed on the system. It can be compiled in Visual Studio 2013 (Windows)
or through the included makefile, generated by cmake (Linux). The photo it uses
is hard coded, but this can easily be changed to take a filename as an argument.
For more info, read the included report in the Documents directory.
